# AI-Driven Development for Everyone

Build complete applications using AI - no coding experience required!

## What This Means

You can build real, working applications by simply **describing what you want** in plain language. The AI handles all the technical details.

---

## Simple Workflow (Non-Coder Friendly)

### Step 1: Start Your Project

```bash
npx create-laju-app my-project
cd my-project
npm run dev
```

That's it! Your project is now running at `http://localhost:5555`

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project

The AI will help you set up your project:

**Replace README.md:**
```
AI: "Let's update README.md with your project details.
What should we call this project?
What does it do?
Who will use it?"
```

**Initialize Git:**
```
AI: "Now let's set up git so we can save your progress.
I'll initialize the repository and make the first commit."
```

You don't need to do anything - the AI handles it automatically!

### Step 3: Tell AI What You Want to Build

Open your AI assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and describe your app in simple terms:

```
I want to build a simple task management app where:
- Users can create projects
- Each project has tasks
- Tasks can be marked as done or not done
- Show all tasks on a dashboard
```

### Step 4: Let AI Build It

The AI will:
1. Ask you clarifying questions (answer them in plain language)
2. Create all the necessary files automatically
3. Set up the database
4. Build the user interface
5. Make everything work together
6. **Auto-save your progress** (you don't need to worry about git)

You just need to review and say "yes" or "make changes".

### Step 5: Test Your App

Open `http://localhost:5555` in your browser and try it out!

If something doesn't work right, just tell the AI:
```
The create project button doesn't work, please fix it
```

The AI will fix it and save the changes automatically.

### Step 6: Keep Improving

Want to add more features? Just ask:
```
Add the ability to assign tasks to people
```

The AI will:
1. Add the feature
2. Test it
3. Save your progress automatically
4. Update your README with the new feature

## Real Example: Building a Blog

### What You Say:

```
I want a simple blog where:
- I can write and publish articles
- People can read articles
- Each article has a title and content
- Show a list of all articles on the homepage
```

### What AI Does (Automatically):

1. **Creates database** - Sets up tables for articles
2. **Builds admin panel** - Page where you write articles
3. **Creates homepage** - Shows all articles to readers
4. **Makes it look nice** - Clean, modern design
5. **Connects everything** - All features work together

### What You Do:

1. Review the AI's work
2. Test it in your browser
3. Ask for changes if needed
4. Done!

## Tips for Non-Coders

### Be Specific About Features

**Good:**
```
Users can create projects with a name and description
```

**Too Vague:**
```
Make a project management thing
```

### Describe in Business Terms, Not Technical

**Good:**
```
When a user creates a task, it should show up on their dashboard
```

**Too Technical:**
```
Create a task table with foreign key to users and render on dashboard
```

### Think About the User Experience

Describe what happens step by step:
```
1. User clicks "New Project" button
2. A form appears asking for project name and description
3. User fills in the form and clicks "Create"
4. The project is saved and appears in the project list
```

### Start Simple, Add Later

Don't try to build everything at once. Start with the basics:

**First iteration:**
```
Create projects with name only
```

**Second iteration:**
```
Add description field to projects
```

**Third iteration:**
```
Add tasks to projects
```

## Common Questions

### Do I need to know any programming?

**No!** You just need to be able to:
- Describe what you want in plain language
- Use a computer
- Browse the web

### What if the AI makes a mistake?

Just tell it:
```
This doesn't work as expected. [Describe what's wrong]
```

The AI will fix it.

### Can I change my mind later?

Yes! Just tell the AI:
```
I want to change how the dashboard looks. Show tasks grouped by project instead of a list
```

### How do I deploy my app?

When you're happy with your app, ask the AI:
```
How do I deploy this app so others can use it?
```

The AI will guide you through the process.

### What if I don't understand something the AI says?

Ask the AI to explain:
```
I don't understand what you mean by [technical term]. Please explain in simple terms.
```

## Example Conversations

### Example 1: Simple Feature Request

**You:**
```
I want users to be able to delete projects
```

**AI:**
```
I'll add a delete button to each project card. When clicked, it will ask for confirmation, then delete the project. Should I proceed?
```

**You:**
```
Yes, that sounds good
```

**AI:**
```
Done! I've added the delete functionality. You can now delete projects from the project list page.
```

### Example 2: Fixing a Problem

**You:**
```
When I try to create a task, nothing happens
```

**AI:**
```
Let me check the code... I see the issue. The form isn't submitting correctly. I'll fix it now.
```

**AI:**
```
Fixed! Try creating a task again. It should work now.
```

### Example 3: Making Changes

**You:**
```
I want the task list to show the most recent tasks first
```

**AI:**
```
I'll update the sorting to show tasks in descending order by creation date. Done!
```

## Advanced: When You Want More Control

As you get more comfortable, you can start learning the technical details. But you don't have to - the simple workflow works perfectly fine for building complete applications.

If you're curious, you can ask the AI:
```
Can you explain how the database works?
```
```
What files were created for the project feature?
```

The AI will teach you at your own pace.

---
